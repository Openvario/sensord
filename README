Release Notes: 
Jan 5 2021

1) It has been found that timing jitter on the MS5611 pressure sensors results in glitches.  As a result, an attempt has been made
to reduce jitter, detect jitter, and to compensate for jitter when detected.  This compensation scheme requires the introduction
of a new program called "compdata".  Typical usage is:

/opt/bin/compdata -s -c /opt/conf/sensord.conf

The program will prompt you to enter the number of data points (in thousands), up to 9999.  It should be noted that it takes roughly
1 minute per thousand data points.  Recommendation is you choose a minimum of 5.  This can be entered either with a keyboard or 
by use of the joystick or rotary encoders in an intuitive fashion.

Upon completion of the program the configuration file (/opt/conf/sensord.conf) will have compensation data appended to it, which will
automatically be used by sensord the next time it starts.  The configuration file should already contain default compensation data.
Whenever the compdata is run and data is saved, it will append to the end of the config file.  Sensord will always choose the
compensation data that appears last in the file.

PLEASE NOTE that compdata will report whether it thinks values it determines are good or bad.  At this point it may be best to
disregard "BAD" if found describing coefficients.  However, Overrun/underrun errors, or > 70 on std deviation is bad.  If these
occur, you should re-run compdata.

2) Another new change is in the cal program.  Cal is used to determine the mean offset on the pitot sensor when there is no pressure 
differential.  Previously, cal took 10 measurements, ~1 second apart, reported them and averaged them.  The data is then stored on 
the EEPROM.  The new version will take 800 measures 12.5ms apart, average them, and store the data to the EEPROM, but will not report
them.  This should give more accurate results.

3) At this point in time it is recommended that sensord, variod, and pulseaudio are run as a forked service or from the commandline.
When run as a regular service this can make the timing jitter worse, and results in erroneous vario readings, as well as clicks and 
pops on the audio.  It is not presently understood why this makes a difference.
