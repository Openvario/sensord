// This header file is for si7021.c which supports the following sensors:
// Sensirion: SHT40, SHT41, SHT45, SHT85 (SHT71 and SHT75 may work)
// Silicon Labs: SI7006, SI7013, SI7020, SI7021
// Tyco Electronics/Measurement Specialties: HTU21D, HTU31D
//
// Note: The only sensor that has been tested is the HTU21D, the routines
// support the use of the heater function, but it is NOT used by sensord
